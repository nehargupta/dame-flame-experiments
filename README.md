# Experiments on the DAME and FLAME algorithms
The DAME and FLAME algorithms provide fast, large-scale, and high-quality interpretable matches in causal inference. This document serves to replicate some experiments shown by Liu, et al. in this paper, but rather than use the authors' experimental code, I use the DAME-FLAME Python package, which is publicy available for download here.

This code was written by Neha Gupta, with some data generating and visualization code copied from Yameng Liu, Awa Dieng. For questions on this code, or on the DAME-FLAME Python Package, please contact Neha at neha.r.gupta "at" duke "dot" edu.
