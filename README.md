# Experiments on the DAME and FLAME algorithms

The DAME and FLAME algorithms provide fast, large-scale, and high-quality interpretable matches in causal inference. This document serves to replicate experiments of Figure 2, as shown by Liu, et al. in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06802), but rather than use the authors' experimental code, I use the DAME-FLAME Python package, which is publicy available for download [here](https://pypi.org/project/dame-flame/). 

This code was written by Neha Gupta, with some data generating and visualization code copied from Yameng Liu, Awa Dieng. For questions on this code, or on the DAME-FLAME Python Package, please contact Neha at neha.r.gupta "at" duke "dot" edu.
