# Experiments on the DAME and FLAME algorithms

The DAME and FLAME algorithms provide fast, large-scale, and high-quality interpretable matches in causal inference.

The document DAME_vs_FLAME_match_quality.ipynb serves to replicate experiments of Figure 2, as shown by Liu, et al. in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06802), but rather than use the authors' experimental code, I use the DAME-FLAME Python package, which is publicy available for download [here](https://pypi.org/project/dame-flame/). 

The rest of the documents in this repository are examples that accompany the documentation here: https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package/examples/

This code was written by Neha Gupta, with some data generating and visualization code copied from Yameng Liu, Awa Dieng and Tianyu Wang. For questions on this code, or on the DAME-FLAME Python Package, please contact Neha at neha.r.gupta "at" duke "dot" edu.
